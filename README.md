**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I l learned how to implement callbacks for mouse click and keydown, and use them
to implement the accordion pattern.

I used Flexbox to aligh elements (text and icon) vertically.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about the Flexbox model and Grid model. 

I also want to be more familiar with the DOM model and how to select DOM elements 
in javascript.
